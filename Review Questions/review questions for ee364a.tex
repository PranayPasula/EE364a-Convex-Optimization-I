\section*{Chapter 2 -- Convex Sets}

\subsubsection*{Affine Set}
\qnum What is an affine set? \\
\qnum Describe an affine set using set notation. \\
\qnum What are some examples of affine sets? \\
\qnum Is any affine set the solution to a linear system of equations?

\subsubsection*{Convex Set}
\qnum What is a convex set? \\
\qnum Describe a convex set using set notation. \\
\qnum Are affine sets also convex sets? Why or why not? \\
\qnum Are null sets also convex sets? Why or why not? \\
\qnum What do convex sets look like in $\Rn$? \\
\qnum How does the definition of convexity apply to a set $S \nsubseteq \Rn$? Say, for $S = \Snpp$? \\
\qnum What is the interior of a set? \\
\qnum Give examples of convex sets with an interior equal to the empty set.

\subsubsection*{Convex Combination}
\qnum What is a convex combination? \\
\qnum What is a convex hull? \\
\qnum What is the convex hull of a convex set? \\
\qnum How do convex combinations differ from affine combinations?

\subsubsection*{Convex Cone}
\qnum What is a cone? \\
\qnum What is a convex cone? \\
\qnum Why is a convex cone considered to be convex even though the constraints on weights are different than what is required by the definition of convexity? \\
\qnum What is a conic combination? \\
\qnum What is a conic hull?
\qnum What convex cone that contains a set is bigger than the conic hull of that set?

\subsubsection*{Hyperplane}
\qnum What is a hyperplane? \\
\qnum Describe a hyperplane using set notation. \\
\qnum Describe how the variables in the definition of a hyperplane determine the hyperplane. \\
\qnum Is a hyperplane a vector space? \\
\qnum Is a hyperplane a subspace? \\
\qnum Is a hyperplane an affine subspace? \\
\qnum How does the definition of an affine subspace differ from the definition of a vector space? How do the relate? \\
\qnum Does every affine subspace contain a vector space? \\
\qnum Does every vector space contain an affine subspace? \\
\qnum What is the dimension of a hyperplane? \\
\qnum What is the codimension of a hyperplane? \\
\qnum What is meant by codimension in this context? When does is the codimension defined in this context? \\
\qnum Is a hyperplane convex? Affine? 

\subsubsection*{Halfspace}
\qnum What is a halfspace?\\
\qnum If a halfspace contains the origin, is it a vector space?\\
\qnum Is a halfspace convex?\\
\qnum Is a halfspace affine?\\
\qnum How does the definition of a halfspace relate to the definition of a hyperplane?
